 PHP Learning Project

A structured, handsâ€‘on repository for learning PHP step by step. Each **lesson** lives in its own numbered folder (e.g., `01-hello-world`, `02-variables`), includes a short README, and practical code you can run locally. The goal is to build real PHP skills through small, focused exercises.

---

## âœ¨ Highlights

* **Numbered lessons** with clear objectives and completion checklists
* **Runnable examples** for each topic
* **Professional project layout** and contribution workflow
* **Beginnerâ€‘friendly run instructions** (XAMPP/WAMP/Laragon or PHP builtâ€‘in server)
